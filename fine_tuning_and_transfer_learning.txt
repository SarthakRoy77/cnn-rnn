What is fine tuning and transfer learning??
It is when we import models and then change the architecture and tune the hyperparameters accordingly
The first step is to load the model :
torchvision.models.nameofthemodel(pretrained=bool)

The second step is to change the architecture accordingly and to do 
so we first need to know the architecture we can do it by:
print(model) / print(dir(model))

Then just change the architecture:
model.fc = nn.Linear(x,x) and so on

Then just change the hyperparameters to boost accuracy
